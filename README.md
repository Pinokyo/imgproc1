1. I developed a MATLAB program performing histogram equalization on the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

a. First, write your own histogram equalization algorithm. 
b. Then, use built-in histogram equalization function of MATLAB (histeq). 
c. Program should run like >> image_histeq(‘filename.ext’) 
d. Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
  i. Input image and its histogram 
  ii. Output image of your algorithm and its histogram 
  iii. Output image of histeq function and its histogram e. Use “hw2_problem1.tif” to test your program. 
 
 
2. I developed a MATLAB program applying 3x3 averaging filter to the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

a. First, write your own algorithm for filtering. 
b. Size of the output image should be equal to size of the input image. 
c. Then, use built-in image filtering function of MATLAB (filter2) 
d. Program should run like >> image_filter(‘filename.ext’) 
e. Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
  i. Input image 
  ii. Output image of your algorithm 
  iii. Output image of filter2 function f. Use “hw2_problem2.tif” to test your program.

# Image Processing Example 

1. I developed a MATLAB program performing histogram equalization on the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

- [x] First, write your own histogram equalization algorithm. 
- [x] Then, use built-in histogram equalization function of MATLAB (histeq). 
- [x] Program should run like >> image_histeq(‘filename.ext’) 
- [x] Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
     - Input image and its histogram. 
     - Output image of your algorithm and its histogram. 
     - Output image of histeq function and its histogram e. Use “hw2_problem1.tif” to test your program. 
 
 
2. I developed a MATLAB program applying 3x3 averaging filter to the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

- [x] First, write your own algorithm for filtering. 
- [x] Size of the output image should be equal to size of the input image. 
- [x] Then, use built-in image filtering function of MATLAB (filter2) 
- [x] Program should run like >> image_filter(‘filename.ext’) 
- [x] Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
     - Input image.
     - Output image of your algorithm.
     - Output image of filter2 function f. Use “hw2_problem2.tif” to test your program.

# Image Processing 

- I developed a MATLAB program performing histogram equalization on the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

1. First, write your own histogram equalization algorithm. 
2. Then, use built-in histogram equalization function of MATLAB (histeq). 
3. Program should run like >> image_histeq(‘filename.ext’) 
4. Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
  - i. Input image and its histogram 
  - ii. Output image of your algorithm and its histogram 
  - iii. Output image of histeq function and its histogram e. Use “hw2_problem1.tif” to test your program. 
 
 
- I developed a MATLAB program applying 3x3 averaging filter to the input (grayscale) image. The requested are as follows:

1. First, write your own algorithm for filtering. 
2. Size of the output image should be equal to size of the input image. 
3. Then, use built-in image filtering function of MATLAB (filter2) 
4. Program should run like >> image_filter(‘filename.ext’) 
5. Program should finally display the items below in the same window (Hint. Use subplot function). 
  - i. Input image 
  - ii. Output image of your algorithm 
  - iii. Output image of filter2 function f. Use “hw2_problem2.tif” to test your program.
